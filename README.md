# NodeJwtRsa

Using Public/Private keys to make/verify JavaScript Web Tokens (JWT)

## How to run

1. `npm i` to restore package
2. `node index.js` or `npm start` to run

## Why this demo?

It turns out how to do this is far less than obvious, so we made a little demo showing how to help out the next people.

## Simple demos are better

We stripped out everything that was not needed e.g. web components like express, login services, etc. 

The presumption of this demo is you can make your own payloads, but that you want an easy to follow guide to using public/private keys to make and verify JWT.
